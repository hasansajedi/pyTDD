# Test-driven development (TDD) Demo

> Test-driven development (TDD) is a process that has been documented considerably over recent years. A process of baking your tests right into your everyday coding, as opposed to a nagging afterthought, should be something that developers seek to make the norm, rather than some ideal fantasy.

## What Is Test-Driven Development?
> TDD, in its most basic terms, is the process of implementing code by writing your tests first, seeing them fail, then writing the code to make the tests pass. You can then build upon this developed code by appropriately altering your test to expect the outcome of additional functionality, then writing the code to make it pass again.

> You can see that TDD is very much a cycle, with your code going through as many iterations of tests, writing, and development as necessary, until the feature is finished. By implementing these tests before you write the code, it brings out a natural tendency to think about your problem first. While you start to construct your test, you have to think about the way you design your code. What will this method return? What if we get an exception here? And so on. 

> By developing in this way, it means you consider the different routes through the code, and cover these with tests as needed. This approach allows you to escape the trap that many developers fall into (myself included): diving into a problem and writing code exclusively for the first solution you need to handle.

## The process can be defined as such:

Write a failing unit test
Make the unit test pass
Refactor
Repeat this process for every feature, as is necessary.
